## <h1 align="center"> 🧑‍💻 Description | Development 👩‍💻 </h1>



 Back-End developed in JavaScript, using Express, Mongosh and Mongoose for solid integration with a MongoDB database. Bcrypt and JSON Web Token to ensure the security of user data. Also, use Nodemailer to confirm emails and recover password. We also use the Multer to be able to send a photo from the body
 Front-End developed with JavaScript, we use React.JS as a framework.

## *Endpoints* - IN THE BACK-END

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

We have created a social network with different types of Endpoints, some of which are very specific and secure. We implemented the isAuthor middleware, which makes the social network more secure. All endpoints were tested in Postman before we shipped to the Main branch.

## *FUNCTIONS* - IN THE FRONT-END
